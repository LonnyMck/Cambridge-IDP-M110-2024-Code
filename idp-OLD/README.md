# Integrated Design Project 2023
Team M109's IDP project for Cambridge University Engineering Department, where you make a robot to grab foam blocks of two different densities and place them in different areas depending.

## To do list:
* Calibrate wheels to drive straight - ✅

* ~~Calibrate claw - ✅
* Write ```line_search()``` to search for blocks on lines - Lonny
* ~~Fix hunting (currently identifying fine but not reaching)✅~~
  - ~~Implement Mini-Sweep - Jamie~~

* Deliver block (should just be ```home()``` then turn left/right and deliver)
  - Need to go across the gap - Lonny (go from centre to left/right)
* New homing system (return to center) - Should be good
* Fix ```follow_line()``` - Angus
